## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name's Guilherme;  
I am a Web Developer specializing in Vue.js 3 and Sass, eager to transition my expertise from personal projects to a professional setting.  
With a  passion for JavaScript and gaming I'm always aiming to provide enjoyable experiences. 
## What am I doing now?
### Plenty o' Darts  
Plenty O' Darts it's small and simple Terraria mod that aims to explore and give more functionalities to darts in the game, the mod alters the properties of existent darts and create new ones capable of ignoring enemies defences and immunities.  
_The source code for the mod will be on github soon..._  

### [Biero](https://github.com/guilherme-hja/biero)
Biero ('Beer' in Esperanto) is my second interactive library that uses the free API '[TheCocktaildb](Thecocktaildb.com)', the project aims to provide a easy and simple way to browse between many cocktail drink options, varying from type, category, used glass and even separating whats alcohoolic and what is not. It also provides instructions on how to make those drinks, providing procedures and ingredients.
Different from Veisla, Biero uses Typescript alongside Vue.

## Completed Projects
### [Veisla](https://veisla.vercel.app)  
Veisla (Banquet in Icelandic) is a interactive library that aims to provide plenty of meals options, varying from regions, to categories and ingredients, allowing the user a diverse number of recipes with all the information and instructions necessary to make a delicious Banquet (and it also provides videos for the lazy readers)   
The project, made with Javascript, Scss and Vue, uses [TheMealDB](themealdb.com) free API to get the data.
The whole purpose was to how far my studies had led me and I'm happy with the results.  

## What do you have in mind?
I am excited about the opportunity to bring my creativity, technical skills, and dedication to your team, where I can contribute to innovative projects and further my professional growth.
If you have any challenges I'd be happy to venture on them.
